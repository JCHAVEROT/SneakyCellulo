Sneaky Cellulo is a virtual/real-world hybrid game featuring virtual and physical instances of Cellulo robot.

Game scenario: You embody a robot, from another dimension. You just landed in an harsh environment, completely unknown to you. Your only way to make your way back home is to go through several trials. Beware, on your path will stand some pitiless, ruthless, merciless, heartless, callous guards (did I mention they were cold-hearted?) that you're gonna need to outsmart for your survival.  Remember, some walls are not as stout and solid as they may seem. What a great hint I'm giving you. Maybe I should have given the same advice to the prior lost traveler, we could have prevented the worst from happening.. Anyway there is no point in talking endlessly, I hope you will be successful in your journey.
